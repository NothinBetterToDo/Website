                        <h1>Something about myself</h1>
                        <p>Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English 
                            to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient 
                            tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, 
                            font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. 
                            Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content 
                            nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles 
                            classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters 
                            K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence 
                            of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.
                        </p>

                        <p>In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be made 
                            and presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with content 
                            hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a 
                            random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the 
                            layout and its elements. Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable 
                            risk in corporate environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early 1960ies, 
                            and quite likely since the sixteenth century.
